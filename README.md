## General information

This project was inspired by Codecademy and has provided an opportunity for me to practice what I have learned about javascript, markdown, git and git hub. The simple messages generated by program make me smile and I plan to run the program each day. I would be happy for other git hub users to add new messages to the program to expand my horizons!
